In the case of opls_135, our definition only states that at least 3 of the neighbors are hydrogen, and have not made any specific claims about the identity of the 4th neighbor; similarly, for opls_136, we have only stated that 2 neighbors must be hydrogen and not specified the identity of the other 2 neighbors. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is an important feature of Foyer to take note of.  Foyer will evaluate all the rules in a forcefield file, rather than just stopping at the first rule that evaluates to `True`. This allows rules to be defined in any order.  Furthermore, Foyer iterates over the rules, which allows recursive definitions of usage, i.e., referring to specific atom-types in the SMARTS string. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Overrides\n",
    "We will discuss two ways to address this. One approach is to employ `overrides`.  `overrides` provide a means to dictate rule precedence (i.e., which rules are more specific than others).  In the force field file above, `opls_138` has defined: `overrides=\"opls_135,opls_136\"`.  That is, if `opls_138` evaluates to `True`, then it takes precedence over `opls_135` and `opls_136`, even if they evaluate to `True`. \n",

    "Similarly, if opls_136 evaluates to `True`, it `overrides=\"opls_136\"`, thus taking precedence. \n",
    "\n",
    "`overrides` are especially useful if the chemical context of two different atom-types are effectively the same.  E.g., the terminal methyl group in an alkane has the same first neighbor environment as the methyl group in toluene, however the parameters (and thus atom-type) are different. Thus `overrides` can be used to state that if the more specific toluene rule evaluates to `True` it should take precedences over the more general alkane rule (as shown below):\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../graphics/ch3-toluene.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 700px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Better SMARTS definitions\n",
    "In many cases, `overrides` can be avoided by simply providing more specific SMARTS strings.  For example, the rules for `opls_135`, `opls_136`, and `opls_138` above can be made more specific by stating the identify of the other neighbors besides carbon and thus eliminate the need for `overrides`, as shown below.

    "#### Notes: \n",
    "* Foyer will evaluate all the rules in a forcefield file, rather than just stopping at the first rule that evaluates to `True`\n",
    "    * This allows rules to be defined in any order\n",
    "* Foyer iterates over the rules (iterating until no changes our found)\n",
    "    * This allows recursive definitions of usage, i.e., referring to specific atom-types in the SMARTS string, as will be discussed later \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### `overrides`  \n",
    "`overrides` provide a means to dictate rule precedence (i.e., which rules are more specific than others).  \n",
    "\n",
    "In the force field file above, `opls_138` has defined: `overrides=\"opls_135,opls_136\"`:  \n",
    " * That is, if `opls_138` evaluates to `True`, then it takes precedence over `opls_135` and `opls_136`, even if they evaluate to `True`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, if opls_135 evaluates to `True`, it `overrides=\"opls_136\"`, because opls_135 is more specific, thus taking precedence. \n",
    "\n",
    "### More specific SMARTS definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Recursive definitions \n",
    "`overrides` are especially useful if the chemical context of two different atom-types are effectively the same.  E.g., the terminal methyl group in an alkane has the same first neighbor environment as the methyl group in toluene, however the parameters (and thus atom-type) are different. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus `overrides` can be used to state that if the more specific toluene rule evaluates to `True` it should take precedences over the more general alkane rule. Also note that in the SMARTS for toluene, we use a recursive definition.  That is, we use an atom-type name in addition to the element, i.e., `[C;X4](C;%opls_145)(H)(H)H`.  This states that the carbon we are connected to must be opls_145 to evaluate to true.  We can use these recursive definitions because atom-typing is performed as an iterative process in Foyer. Obviously, if we use recursive definitions for all of our SMARTS, we will not be able to atom-type.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../graphics/ch3-toluene.png\" alt=\"toluene\" style=\"width: 700px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Longer range patterns\n",
    "In many cases, recursive definitions can be avoided by providing more specific SMARTS strings.  For example, we could instead take note of the fact that opls_145 only has 3 connections:\n",
    "\n",
    "`[C;X4](C;X3)(H)(H)H`\n",
    "\n",
    "We could also state the identify of those connections if necessary (or even define then entire opls_145 SMARTS pattern, `[C;X3;r6]1[C;X3;r6][C;X3;r6][C;X3;r6][C;X3;r6][C;X3;r6]1`), although the larger definitions may begine to be less clear. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often times more specific definitions can remove the need to define `overrides`.  For example, the rules for `opls_135`, `opls_136`, and `opls_138` above can be made more specific by stating the identify of the other neighbors and thus eliminate the need for `overrides`, as shown below.  It is important to note that some force fields are designed such to have \"generic\" parameters that we would default to if more specific cases are not available. \n",

    "Foyer has been undergoing development to support GMSO. Interaction with foyer is very similar to the prior example,  where we load in a forcefield and pass the mbuild compound to the apply function of the forcefield to perform atom typing.  The apply function returns here a GMSO topology, rather than a ParmEd topology, and thus for the GMSO topology, the save command provides us with access to file writers for all the supported engines.

      " |  \n",
      " |  Notes\n",
      " |  -----\n",
      " |  There are two different approaches to using the Polymer class to create\n",
      " |  polymers\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  1) Pass in already created Compound instances to the monomers and end_groups\n",
      " |  parameters when creating a Polymer instance:\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |      You can then call the Polymer.build() method to create a polymer.\n",
      " |      This approach can be used if the compounds being passed into the Polymer\n",
      " |      instance already have the ports created, and correct atomic structure to\n",
      " |      allow for the monomer-monomer and monomer-end group bonds. These\n",
      " |      compounds are used as-is when creating the polymer chain.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |      Example\n",
      " |      -------\n",
      " |      >>> chain = Polymer(\n",

      " |      ... )\n",
      " |      >>> chain.build(n=5)\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |  2) Use the add_monomer() and add_end_group() methods:\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |      These functions are there to help with the creation of mb.Ports, which\n",
      " |      are required by the build() method, and they help with the removal of\n",
      " |      any atoms (hydrogens) that are occupying what should be the monomer-\n",
      " |      monomer and monomer-end group bonding sites.  With this approach, create\n",
      " |      a Polymer() instance, then call the add_monomer() and add_end_group()\n",
      " |      methods before calling the build() method.\n",
      " |  \n",
      " |      Example\n",
      " |      -------\n",
      " |      >>> chain = Polymer()\n",

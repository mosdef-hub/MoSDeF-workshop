In this tutorial we will explore some of mBuild's basic functionality by constructing a linear alkane chain. We'll then examine how mBuild's component-based design approach allows components to be easily swapped to facilitate structural screening."

    "* Molecules feature a tree-like hierarchy (as shown in the figure below)\n",
    "* All components in the hierarchy feature a common data structure (an mBuild `Compound`)\n",
    "* The lowest level of the hierarchy (the 'leaves') are referred to as particles and are typically individual atoms\n",

There are several ways to interrogate what is contained within a `Compound` (e.g. `type`, `dir`, `list`). mBuild `Compounds` feature [a variety of useful methods and attributes](https://mbuild.mosdef.org/en/stable/topic_guides/data_structures.html#) to facilitate system construction.\n",

This aids in the atomtyping and forcefield application process (using the Foyer package) which we will get back to later.\n",
